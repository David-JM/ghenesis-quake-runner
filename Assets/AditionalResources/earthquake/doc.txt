Hi. thanks for using this asset.

To use the earthquake, simply drag the script on an object. The script will automatically add the rigidbody at runtime, and the the right properties.
I strongly recommend to see the demo scene, to have an idea of how this asset should be used

To manipulate the options of the script, you have two methods: in the inspector, or by scripting at runtime. The important attributes are:


 - Earthquake.Running:
	to start the script simply use: "Earthquake.Running = true". Use the value "false" to stop the script.
	
 - Earthquake.magnitude:
	The force of the quake. Basically, it will define how "large" are the movements of your object
	
 - Earthquake.shakingSpeed:
	The speed of the floor at maximum force.
	
 - Earthquake.randomAmount:
	This variable define How random the movement of your floor will be
	
 - Earthquake.duration:
	The total duration of the quake;
	
 - Earthquake.forceByAxis:
	A vector3 defining the axes affected by the movements. At runtime, the values will automatically be cropped between 0 and 1
	
 - Earthquake.forceOverTime:
	An animationcurve defining the force of the quake over time
	
 - Earthquake.loop:
	set true if you want the quake event to loop.
	
 - Earthquake.forceRecenter:
	When the random is applied to the floor, is position may change. If you want your floor to slowly center to his start position, set this option to true
 
You can check the quakeGUI script to see how I manipulate the script.
