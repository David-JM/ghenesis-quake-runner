For a demo scene, you need to import the standard Asset Unity - "Characters".


How it works?

1. You need to attach the AudioSource to the GameObject Player and leave it empty.
2. Then attach the EECE_Player_Camera.cs script to the GameObject Player.
3. Select the mode in the attached script (Select "infinite" if you want the effect to never stop.).
3.1. If you want one-time operation, then you need to create any object and set the Collider "Is Trigger" checkbox and tag "Hit".
3.2. If you want infinite trigger, then you need to create any object and set the Collider "Is Trigger" checkbox and tag "Infinite".
4. Add your sounds to the script (Shake Hit and Infinite Loop).
5. Enjoy!
